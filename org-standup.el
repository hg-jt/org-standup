;;; Commentary:

;; org-standup provides utilities for managing daily standup notes in
;; org-mode.  Each day's standup notes are stored in a separate file in
;; a well defined directory hierarchy:
;;
;;  .
;;  └── yyyy
;;      └── mm
;;          ├── dd.org
;;          └── ...
;;
;; org-standup does not have any external package dependencies.
;;
;; Installation:
;;   M-x package-install-file <path to org-standup.el>
;;
;;
;; Configuration:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
;;            (lambda ()
;;              ;; initialize the template
;;              (eval-after-load 'autoinsert (org-standup-template-init))
;;
;;              ;; enable auto-insert
;;              (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)))
